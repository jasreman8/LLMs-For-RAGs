# LLMs-For-RAGs
This repository contains all projects that were created while learning to create RAG systems using LLMs.

**Project 1:** Creating a RAG-based Q&A system for PowerBI documentation:
- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable real-time Q&A over PowerBI documentation
- Created and managed document embeddings using ChromaDB vector store
- Implemented CRUD operations for vector ingestion, updates, and retrieval
- Enabled context-grounded responses for Power BI features, functions, and best practices
